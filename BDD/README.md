# BDD

BDD stands for Behavior-Driven Development. It is a software development approach that focuses on collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders. BDD aims to improve communication and understanding by using a common language to describe the behavior of a system. This approach involves writing executable specifications in the form of scenarios that describe the expected behavior of the system from the user's perspective. These scenarios are typically written using a Given-When-Then format, where the Given section sets up the initial state, the When section describes the action being performed, and the Then section defines the expected outcome. BDD frameworks, such as Cucumber, can be used to automate the execution of these scenarios and ensure that the system behaves as expected. BDD promotes a collaborative and iterative approach to software development, where the focus is on delivering value to the end users.
