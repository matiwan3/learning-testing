TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, allowing developers to catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.

Advantages of TypeScript over JavaScript include:
- Strong typing: TypeScript enforces static typing, which helps catch errors early and improves code quality.
- Enhanced tooling: TypeScript provides better IDE support, including autocompletion, type checking, and refactoring tools.
- Improved scalability: TypeScript supports features like classes, modules, and interfaces, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications.
- Better code organization: TypeScript encourages the use of modules and namespaces, making code more modular and reusable.
- Compatibility with JavaScript: TypeScript can be seamlessly integrated with existing JavaScript codebases, allowing for gradual adoption and easy migration.

TypeScript
- Static Typing - C++, C#, Java, (Allows to catch bugs on debug level) - Type checking 
- Dynamically-typed: JavaScript, Python, Ruby
Benefits:
- Static typing
- Code completition
- Refactoring
- Shorthand notaons

Drawbbacks
- translate typescript to javascript (transplantation)
- Discipline in coding

## Installation
```
npm i -g typescript
tsc -v
index.ts
```

## compile and run
``` 
tsc --init  
tsc  
tsc && node dist/index11.js
```
