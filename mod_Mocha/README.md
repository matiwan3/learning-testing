# Mocha

Mocha is a powerful testing framework for JavaScript that runs on both Node.js and in the browser. It provides a simple and flexible syntax for writing test cases and supports various testing styles such as BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) and TDD (Test-Driven Development). With Mocha, you can easily organize and execute your tests, generate detailed reports, and handle asynchronous code using promises or callbacks. It also integrates well with other libraries and tools, making it a popular choice for testing JavaScript applications.
