# Jest

When you run npx jest, Jest is executing your tests locally in a Node.js environment. Jest is a testing framework that does not run in the browser but rather in a Node.js environment, which means it does not directly interact with your HTML page.

Here's how the files and the test code are correlated and executed:

Understanding the Correlation:
Testing in Jest (Node.js environment):

The test_testing-page.js file is a Jest test file.
It contains a set of tests for the login function, which is defined within the same file.
This file is entirely self-contained. It does not reference the HTML page (testing-page.html) or any JavaScript code within it.
The login function is tested using predefined data in the users array within the test file itself.
HTML Page:

The testing-page.html file is a standalone HTML file with embedded JavaScript.
This JavaScript handles form submission and user authentication by checking against a hardcoded list of users.
The JavaScript in the HTML file is independent and is not run or tested by Jest.
Execution Environment:
Jest Environment:

Jest runs in a Node.js environment, which means it does not have access to the DOM or browser-specific APIs.
The test cases defined in test_testing-page.js are purely JavaScript logic tests. They are not interacting with the HTML or browser environment.
Browser Environment:

The JavaScript within testing-page.html runs in the browser when the HTML page is loaded and interacted with.
Clarification:
Jest Running Locally:
When you run npx jest, the tests are run locally on your machine within a Node.js environment.
Jest finds and runs all test files (by default, files with .test.js or .spec.js extensions, or in __tests__ folders).
Summary:
The test_testing-page.js file contains tests that run in a Node.js environment, independent of the HTML file.
Jest does not interact with the HTML file or run JavaScript code in the browser.
The tests in test_testing-page.js validate the login function against a local users array defined within the test file itself.
If you want to test the actual interaction with the HTML page (e.g., form submission, DOM manipulation), you would typically use a library like Jest with jsdom for simulating a browser environment, or an end-to-end testing framework like Puppeteer or Cypress.
