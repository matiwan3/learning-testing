# RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is a message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It provides a reliable and scalable way to send and receive messages between different systems.

To use RabbitMQ in your own projects, you will need to install the RabbitMQ library and have a running RabbitMQ server. You can find more information about RabbitMQ and how to get started in the official documentation.

For more information about the RabbitMQ library used in this code, refer to the documentation at: [RabbitMQ Python Client Documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html)
