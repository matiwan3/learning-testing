# Junit

JUnit is a popular Java testing framework that provides a simple and efficient way to write and execute unit tests. It allows developers to test individual units of code, such as methods or classes, in isolation to ensure their correctness. With JUnit, you can easily define test cases, assert expected results, and run tests automatically. It also provides various annotations and assertions to facilitate test organization and verification. JUnit is widely used in the Java community and is an essential tool for test-driven development (TDD) and continuous integration (CI) processes.
