Sure! Here are some potential interview questions for an automation tester specializing in Playwright:

1. Can you explain what Playwright is and how it differs from other automation frameworks?
   Playwright is a powerful automation framework for web browsers that allows you to automate browser actions such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating between pages. It provides a high-level API that makes it easy to write browser automation scripts in JavaScript.

One key feature that sets Playwright apart from other automation frameworks is its **cross-browser support**. Playwright supports multiple browsers including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, allowing you to write tests or automation scripts that can be executed on different browsers without any modifications. This is particularly useful when you need to ensure your application works consistently across different browsers.

Another advantage of Playwright is its focus on reliability and stability. It is built by Microsoft and designed to handle complex scenarios and edge cases that can arise during browser automation. Playwright takes care of handling things like waiting for elements to appear, handling network requests, and managing cookies, making it easier to write robust and reliable automation scripts.

Additionally, Playwright provides powerful debugging capabilities. It allows you to take screenshots and record videos during test execution, which can be helpful for troubleshooting and identifying issues. It also supports headless mode, which means you can run your tests or automation scripts without a visible browser window, making it faster and more efficient.

Overall, Playwright is a versatile and feature-rich automation framework that offers cross-browser support, reliability, and powerful debugging capabilities. It simplifies the process of automating browser actions and helps ensure the quality and consistency of your web applications across different browsers.

2. How would you set up a Playwright project from scratch?
3. What are the advantages of using Playwright over other automation tools?
   Cross-Browser Support: Playwright supports multiple browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. This allows you to write automation scripts that can be executed across different browsers without making significant changes to your code.
